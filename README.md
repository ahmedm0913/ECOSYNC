# ECOSYNC: Intelligent AC Temperature Regulator

![ECOSYNC Banner](images/banner.png) <!-- Replace with actual banner image -->

An intelligent system designed to optimize air-conditioning energy usage in hospitality environments. ECOSYNC aims to improve sustainability by reducing unnecessary power consumption without sacrificing user comfort.

## 🌍 Context

Despite economic growth, Sri Lanka continues to face serious energy shortages. Hotels and large buildings often suffer high energy costs, especially due to air conditioning loads.

> “Our hotel spends an average of LKR 9,800,000 per month on electricity. Through smart control of AC timing and temperature, we observed up to **40–60%** savings.”  
> — *Mr. Akila, Lead Maintenance Engineer, Sophia Hotel Colombo*

## 💡 Problem

Conventional hotel AC systems operate wastefully:

- Power is left on when guests leave rooms.
- Cooling continues even when unnecessary.
- Manual systems fail to optimize energy usage.

## ✅ ECOSYNC Solution

**ECOSYNC** is a modular system combining:

- **KPD (Keycard Presence Detector)**  
  Detects room occupancy via keycard insertion/removal.
  
- **ACC (AC Controller Unit)**  
  Receives signals and adjusts AC temperature via IR.

### 🔧 Operating Modes

| Mode        | Temperature Behavior        |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Eco Mode    | Rises to 25°C when unoccupied |
| Luxury Mode | Rises to 23°C when unoccupied |

Communication happens wirelessly between KPD and ACC using **Bluetooth**.
